# Xuid Scraper
Searches xuids for friend xuids then iterates the scraped xuids. This process wont stop until the program is manually closed.

if you want to remove this repo go report it to github not me, i dont have an email at the moment 

due to debugging print statements this program will use high ammounts of memory if you dont use a terminal that clears text

after testing the scraper with no api request limit, you can expect a 500k XUID database within 4 hours. There are many uses for this data such as visualization of the types of games certain groups play. If you want the docs for the use cases it will be included here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/reference/live/gc-reference-live-toc

# Fixed
Ive found a workaround for the scraper and will push out a tutorial sometime in the future. For the time being, I will not release it because I don't want this method to get patched.
