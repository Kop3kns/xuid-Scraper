# Xuid Scraper
Searches xuids for friend xuids then iterates the scraped xuids. This process wont stop until the program is manually closed.

if you want to remove this repo go report it to github not me, i dont have an email at the moment 

due to debugging print statements this program will use high ammounts of memory if you dont use a terminal that clears text

just tested my newest patch and the script in one hour got in total 4.3 million xuids

# Fixed
Fiddler is now working again, I will upload some of my scripts that use this data for practical use.
